## End-User Observation
### Persona #1: Juan Fernandez

Juan is a senior at Stern studying finance. He has an investment banking job lined up for when he graduates but likes trading stocks as a hobby and for personal profit.

Juan currently has brokerage accounts at Interactive Brokers, Charles Schwab and Robinhood. Additionally, he has a Coinbase account where he sometimes trades cryptocurrencies.

Juan voices concern over not being able to visualize all his investments in a unique dashboard. He wishes he could perform analysis over all his portofolios combined in order to better understand his financial situation.

Some of the features Juan considers would benefit himself are: 
* asset allocation graphs over assets in all his portofolios
* a graph of the historical returns of:
    * all his portfolios combined
    * each portfolio by itself in order to compare them to each other
